# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

# Project Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is an advanced machine learning application designed to predict the presence of multiple diseases using medical imaging and patient data. By leveraging transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forest algorithms, this system aims to provide accurate and efficient disease predictions, aiding healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Objectives
Disease Detection: Accurately predict multiple diseases from medical imaging data.
Model Efficiency: Utilize transfer learning to improve model accuracy and reduce training time for kidney disease prediction. Also using Random forest for heart and liver disease prediction.
Comprehensive Analysis: Integrate patient demographic and clinical data to enhance prediction performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Develop a system that is easy for healthcare professionals and normal person to use and interpret.

# Data Sources
Medical Imaging Data: X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, etc., of various parts of the body.
Patient Data: Demographic information (age, gender, etc.), clinical data (medical history, lab results, etc.).

# Key Features
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception) to leverage existing knowledge from large image datasets and fine-tune them on specific disease datasets.
CNN Architecture: Design and implement CNNs to automatically extract features from medical images.
Random Forest Classifier: Use Random Forest to integrate features from CNNs with patient data for improved disease prediction accuracy.
Multi-Disease Prediction: Capability to predict multiple diseases simultaneously.

# Model Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Normalize and resize medical images.
Clean and preprocess patient demographic and clinical data.

Feature Extraction using CNN:
Utilize pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for feature extraction.
